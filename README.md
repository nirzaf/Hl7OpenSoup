# **Project Requirements and Guidelines: Advanced HL7 Desktop Viewer and Editor**

---

### **1. Project Overview & Purpose**

This project will create a Python-based desktop application to serve as an advanced HL7 Viewer and Editor. The primary goal is to provide healthcare IT professionals with a powerful, locally-installed tool to view, edit, validate, and transform HL7 v2.x messages. The application will simplify working with complex HL7 data by offering a responsive and intuitive user interface that **precisely replicates the layout and workflow of the popular "HL7 Soup" software.** This ensures immediate familiarity and productivity for the target audience. The desired end state is a robust, high-performance desktop application that is immediately usable by anyone experienced with industry-standard HL7 tools.

### **2. Key Objectives**

* Develop an intuitive HL7 message viewer and editor with syntax highlighting and direct content manipulation.
* **Replicate the core UI layout and workflow of HL7 Soup**, including its multi-panel design, to ensure immediate user adoption.
* Implement a comprehensive validation engine that supports standard HL7 schemas and allows for the import of custom schemas.
* Enable robust message management, allowing users to create, save, open, copy, and filter multiple messages locally.
* Provide powerful data transformation capabilities to convert HL7 messages to and from JSON, XML, and CSV formats.

---

### **3. Scope of Work**

#### **In-Scope:**

* **HL7 Message Rendering:** Display HL7 messages in a multi-panel view that mirrors HL7 Soup, including:
    * A main message editor with syntax highlighting.
    * An "Interpretation" panel that translates message codes into human-readable descriptions.
    * A "Segment Grid" view for tabular editing of the selected segment.
    * A "Messages" list panel to manage multiple messages in the current file.
* **Hyperlink Highlighting:** Automatically identify and hyperlink key message components for quick navigation between panels.
* **Message Validation:**
    * Validate messages against a range of HL7 v2.x versions (2.1 through 2.9).
    * Support for importing and validating against custom schemas from local files.
* **Message Editing and Management:**
    * Create, save, copy, and edit messages and message files on the local filesystem.
    * Apply edits to multiple selected messages simultaneously.
* **Message Filtering:** Provide a robust filtering mechanism to find messages within a file based on content or metadata.
* **Data Transformation:**
    * Export HL7 messages to JSON, XML, and CSV (Excel) formats.
    * Import data from JSON, XML, and CSV to create or update HL7 messages.
* **Database Integration (Optional):**
    * Provide functionality to connect to a user-specified MongoDB database.

#### **Out-of-Scope:**

* **Real-time Message Transmission:** This tool is for analysis, not for real-time sending or receiving via MLLP.
* **HL7 v3 and FHIR Support:** The initial version exclusively supports HL7 v2.x.
* **User Authentication and Authorization:** A user management system is not in scope.
* **Unique UI/UX Design:** The interface will not be a new design; it will strictly follow the HL7 Soup model.
* **Cloud-based Storage or Synchronization:** The application will primarily operate on local files.

### **4. Target Audience / End-Users**

* **Primary Audience: Healthcare Interface Analysts and Developers:** These users are often already familiar with tools like HL7 Soup and require a functionally identical environment to troubleshoot, validate, and manipulate messages.
* **Secondary Audience: Healthcare IT Support Staff:** This group will benefit from the clear, established UI paradigm for viewing and understanding message content.
* **Tertiary Audience: Quality Assurance and Testing Teams:** These users will leverage the familiar interface to create test data and validate message formats.

---

### **5. Key Deliverables**

* A packaged, installable desktop application for Windows, macOS, and/or Linux.
* A user guide detailing the features, functionalities, and configuration.
* The ability to import and export custom HL7 validation schemas and rule sets.
* Functionality to export HL7 messages into local JSON, XML, and CSV files.
* Documented configuration settings for an optional MongoDB connection.

---

### **6. High-Level Requirements**

#### **Functional Requirements:**

* The system must parse and render all specified HL7 v2.x message versions.
* Users must be able to open HL7 files via a standard file dialog.
* The system must provide in-line editing for all message segments and fields.
* Users must be able to save edited messages back to the local file system.
* The system must implement a search and filter function that highlights results in the message list and editor, similar to HL7 Soup.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:** The application should launch in under 3 seconds. It should load and render large HL7 files (up to 10MB) within 5 seconds.
* **Responsiveness:** The UI must remain responsive. Long-running tasks should show a progress indicator.
* **Resource Consumption:** The application should have a reasonable memory footprint.
* **Fidelity:** The application's UI and interactive behavior must be a high-fidelity match to the established HL7 Soup application.

#### **User & UI/UX Requirements:**

* **UI Layout Mandate:** The user interface **must** be structured to be an exact visual and functional replica of HL7 Soup. This includes:
    * A central, tabbed editor for viewing raw HL7 messages.
    * A top panel providing a human-readable interpretation of the selected message.
    * A side panel for listing and filtering all messages within the current context.
    * A bottom panel that displays a "Segment Grid" for detailed, field-by-field editing of the currently selected segment.
* **Interaction Model:** All user interactions, such as clicking a field, filtering messages, and applying edits, must follow the interaction patterns established by HL7 Soup.
* **Visual Design:** Color coding for segments, fields, components, and validation errors must match the scheme used in HL7 Soup.

#### **Data Requirements:**

* The system will primarily interact with local `.hl7` or `.txt` files.
* Custom validation rules and highlighting preferences will be stored in local configuration files.
* The application must support UTF-8 character encoding.

#### **Security & Compliance:**

* The application must not transmit any message data over the network unless explicitly configured to connect to a database.
* The optional database connection must support secure connection strings (e.g., SRV records with TLS/SSL).

### **7. Recommended Tech Stack**

* **Core Language:** **Python 3.8+** - Chosen for its strong ecosystem of data processing libraries and cross-platform compatibility.
* **GUI Framework:** **PyQt6** - **Strongly recommended** due to its comprehensive and powerful widget toolkit. Replicating a specific and complex user interface like HL7 Soup requires the high degree of control and flexibility that PyQt6 provides over other frameworks.
* **HL7 Parsing Library:** **hl7apy** or **python-hl7** - A well-maintained Python library for parsing, manipulating, and creating HL7 v2.x messages.
* **Database Connector (Optional):** **Pymongo** - The official Python driver for MongoDB.
* **Packaging:** **PyInstaller** or **cx_Freeze** - To bundle the application into a single, distributable executable.

### **8. Known Constraints & Assumptions**

* **Mandatory UI Design:** The user interface design is **not open to interpretation** and must strictly adhere to the layout, workflow, and interaction patterns of the existing "HL7 Soup" desktop application.
* **Platform Focus:** The primary development target is a desktop environment.
* **Local-First Operation:** The application is designed to work primarily with local files.
* **Third-Party Data:** It is assumed that custom schemas are available as files that can be imported and parsed.
